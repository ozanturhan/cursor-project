## User Requirements & Personas

### User Types
1. Client Users
   - Seeking professional consultation services
   - Booking and attending sessions
   - Managing appointments and payments
   - Viewing professional profiles and reviews

2. Professional Users
   - Offering consultation services
   - Managing availability and bookings

   - Can book sessions as client with legal professionals
   - Maintains separate calendars for each role

2. Skill Exchange and Peer Learning
   Example: Language teachers exchanging lessons
   - Both users are professionals in different languages
   - Can book sessions with each other as clients
   - Manage availability for their own services

3. Professional Development
   Example: Therapist seeking supervision
   - Maintains professional profile for client sessions
   - Books sessions as client for professional development
   - Clear separation between client bookings and professional supervision

4. Role Transition
   Example: Professional starting new service area
   - Initially books sessions as client for learning
   - Gradually builds professional profile in new area
   - Maintains existing professional services

### Role Management Features
1. Profile Management
   - Separate professional and client profiles
   - Option to activate/deactivate professional status
   - Clear indication of current role context

2. Calendar Integration
   - Unified calendar showing all bookings
   - Visual distinction between client and professional appointments
   - Smart conflict prevention across roles

3. Booking System
