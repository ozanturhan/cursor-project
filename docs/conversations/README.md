# Conversation Records

## Purpose
This directory contains records of important technical discussions and decisions made during the development process. These records serve as a historical log of why certain technical choices were made and provide context for future development.

## Structure
Each conversation record is formatted as follows:
- **File Name**: `CONVERSATION-XXX-Brief-Title.md`
- **Content Structure**:
  - Date
  - Participants
  - Context
  - Key Decisions
  - Code Examples (if applicable)
  - Follow-up Actions
  - References
  - Notes

## Benefits
1. **Continuity**: Maintains context across different development sessions
2. **Documentation**: Records why certain decisions were made
3. **Onboarding**: Helps new team members understand the project's evolution
4. **Reference**: Provides historical context for future similar decisions

## Guidelines
1. Create a new record for significant technical discussions
2. Include enough context to understand the discussion without external information
3. Link to relevant RFCs, PRs, or other documentation
4. Keep the format consistent for easy reference
5. Update records if decisions change or evolve
