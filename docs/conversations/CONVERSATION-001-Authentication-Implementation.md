# Conversation Record 001: Authentication Implementation Decisions

## Date

## Context
Initial discussion about implementing the authentication system, focusing on the integration between Next-Auth, NestJS backend, and the handling of API calls.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Authentication Flow
- Decided to use Next-Auth for frontend authentication
- Will implement custom credential provider in Next-Auth
- Backend will generate both access and refresh tokens
- Token refresh mechanism will be handled automatically

### 2. API Communication
- Decided to use React Query instead of useEffect for API calls
- Created custom hooks for API calls (e.g., useProfile)
- Implemented proper loading and error states
- API calls will be authenticated using JWT tokens

### 3. Token Management
- Access tokens will expire after 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens will expire after 7 days
- Implemented automatic token refresh mechanism
- Added proper error handling for token expiration

### 4. Mobile Considerations
- Created separate ApiClient class for mobile app
- Implemented consistent token handling across platforms
- Added proper error handling and retry mechanisms

## Code Examples
Key code examples were documented in RFC-002, including:
- Next-Auth configuration
- React Query implementations
- Token refresh mechanism
- API client implementations

## Follow-up Actions
1. Implement the authentication system based on RFC-002
2. Create necessary database migrations
3. Set up testing environment
4. Implement frontend components

## References
- [RFC-002: Authentication System Design](../rfc/RFC-002-Authentication.md)
- [Database Schema](../DATABASE.md)

## Notes
- Considered alternative approaches like session-based authentication but chose JWT for better scalability
- Mobile implementation details might need further refinement
- Security measures and testing strategy are documented in RFC-002
