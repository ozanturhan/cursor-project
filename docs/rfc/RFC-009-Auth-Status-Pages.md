# RFC-009: Authentication Status Pages

## Status
Proposed

## Summary
Replace URL parameter-based authentication status messages with dedicated status pages for better user experience and security.

## Background
Currently, authentication status messages (success/error) are passed through URL parameters. This approach has several drawbacks:
- Users can manipulate URL parameters to show fake messages
- Messages disappear on page refresh
- URLs become messy and less shareable
- Poor user experience for important auth flows

## Detailed Design

### New Routes
```
/auth/success
  ├── /registration
  ├── /verification
  └── /password-reset

/auth/error
  ├── /verification-failed
  ├── /registration-failed
  └── /password-reset-failed
```

### Success Pages
Each success page will:
- Have a clear success message
- Show next steps
- Include relevant links (e.g., "Go to Login")
- Use consistent success UI components
- Be server-side rendered for immediate feedback

### Error Pages
Each error page will:
- Clearly explain what went wrong
- Provide actionable next steps
- Include retry options where applicable
- Show support contact information
- Use consistent error UI components

### Implementation
1. Create reusable status page components
2. Implement server-side route handlers
3. Update auth flows to redirect to appropriate status pages
4. Remove URL parameter-based messages

## Security Considerations
- Status pages should not expose sensitive information
- Error messages should be user-friendly but not reveal system details
- Rate limiting for retry actions
- Clear session data on error pages where appropriate

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for status components
- Integration tests for auth flows
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
- Security tests for information exposure

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Create base components and routes
- Phase 2: Implement success pages
- Phase 3: Implement error pages
- Phase 4: Update existing auth flows
- Phase 5: Remove URL parameter handling

## Open Questions
1. Should we include support ticket creation on error pages?
2. How long should success messages be displayed before auto-redirect?
3. Should we implement retry limits for certain actions?
